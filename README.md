# Arduino MPU6050 Mouse



Just install on your arduino pro micro and connect an MPU6050 and it should work once installed.

You can also add buttons for left and right click.

WIP:
Adding my code from other computer that helps this run as a VR walking controller where it detects your foot movement and causes you to move forward. 

Backwards movement slighly works 

Overall it is meant for you to stay in place and use the controller as camera movement since 1 wrong movement can cause you to accidentally move somewhere undesired.
